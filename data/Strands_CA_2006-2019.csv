Per Jan Larson Director of Environmental Operations and Planning: On 27 Mar at 1:59pm (PST), the USS PRINCETON was in transit to the Pacific Northwest from Southern CA waters when there was a possible whale strike. The location of the possible whale strike was approximately 48 miles west of Point Loma and to the southeast of San Clemente Island. Visibility was excellent, but no marine mammals were sighted prior to the possible strike. The PRINCETON was underway at 22 kts when a shutter was felt and the aft lookout reported blood and flesh visible in the water. After the ship completed a hard turn, a spout was detected approximately 1500 yards from the location of the possible strike. No other information was available to confirm that a whale strike occurred and no further whale sightings or indications of marine mammal presence (e.g , whale spouts) were observed. The PRINCETON was undamaged and resumed transit to the Pacific Northwest.",

The beach the animal was located is highly active making necropsy very dangerous. As the animal washed in and out of the surf, we were able to collect barnacles, and examine the right side of the whale with certainty. The whale was washed in parallel to beach with only the right side visible. The whale was also orientated belly up, allowing for the sex to be determined. There were numerous barnacles, 20+ under throat, and distal lateral edge of right flipper, and along the distal caudal edges of fluke. No skin left on the fluke made photo fluke ID impossible. Large shark bites and scavenging in armpit and fluke. 6inch perfect circles were scavenged on the right under the throat region. There was a distinct 0.5m hole across just below the eye, could be worn from rocks or other trauma (not certain if prior to death or post mortem). Pictures are located on the MLML stranding network computer. Blubber slabs were taken for tagging study (collaboration with Jim Harvey, ONR project). There was an abscess near fluke that we biopsied. No other samples were taken due to the nature of the wave activity.",

TMMC MBO volunteers were observing the animal and recording respiration rates. MLML staff took over for MBO staff and continued keeping respiration records. The animal was being rolled around in the surf a fair bit, but kept consistent respiration rates for most of the observation period. Scratches on the ventral surface were noticed, likely due to rubbing against the sand as it was being moved around. The animal was able to un-strand itself as the tide increased and swam north of the initial location. It then re-stranded twice more further north. J. Goldbogen (Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University) assisted with tracking the animal later that evening. Visual contact with the whale was lost just before 8:00 PM PDT that evening. Animal was reported as stranded dead late in the morning of 6-13-14. MLML and MBO staff went out to the initial stranding location and verified that it was the same animal that live stranded earlier in the week. MLML staff went back to the location and monitored the carcass to see if it could be secured. The carcass continued to roll in the breaking waves and was unable to be secured. Staff with the MLML network and from Marine Life Studies (MLS) continued monitoring the carcass each day. The carcass remained in the breaking waves. Members of the public reported that the carcass ""exploded"" sometime on 6-14-14. On 6-14-14 blood was occasionally exiting the mouth, and some tissues were exiting the body through the mouth. The jaws appeared loose, possibly indicating that the joint had broken between the upper and lower jaw. Most of the skin had sloughed off from both lateral sides of the animal. Both pectoral fins and parts of the fluke and dorsal fin were removed, likely due to the near constant rolling. By 6-15-14 birds were actively scavenging the carcass and larger pieces of tissues were leaving the body. Two vertebrae from the whale were found on the beach, and one was collected by C. Serraino from MLS and transferred to the freezer at MLML. Last confirmed location for the carcass was at 36º 39.31'N, 121º 49.31'W around 8:30 PM PDT on 6-15-14.

I arrived on the scene about 1000h this morning and was joined by folks from LA County Museum, American Cetacean Society, and the Roundhouse Aquarium (Manhattan Beach). Due to the holiday weekend and the popularity of this beach, LA County was adamant about getting the whale towed off the beach as soon as possible. They gave us a little over 2hours to work on the carcass. We started with getting photos, measurements, and collecting epi-biota. We then took some skin and blubber samples for genetics to determine stock. We also collected some muscle for Rachael Cartwright (CSU-Channel Islands). In addition to that we took a fecal sample for biotoxin analysis and collected some intestinal worms and a few plates of baleen. LA County then (unsuccessfully) attempted to tow the whale off (at low tide mind you) using a bulldozer and two towing lifeguard boats. The carcass was rolled over a few times so we did get a decent look at the dorsal surface as well. The whale was finally towed off the beach at 1900h. Whale floated back near shore and was towed off multiple times over the next 17 days, finally washing ashore and taken to landfill in Encinitas.",

Animal was originally reported by the United States Coast Guard at Yerba Buena Island 1/5/17 when a vessel, NYK Triton, had what appeared to be a whale size animal or possible whale carcass on its bow. As the vessel turned into Oakland Bar channel, the carcass fell off the bow and sank. The whale was then reported on 1/7/17 floating in Oakland harbor off of Howard Terminal. Two personnel from TMMC went out to assess the animal, take pictures and collect basic samples. Due to the storm with large swells, high winds and rainfall the animal was left floating next to the Howard Terminal. The USCG received a report of the animal floating in the Oakland harbor channel on 1/9/17 causing hazards to passing vessels. The animal was then towed to Angel Island by the Army Corps of Engineers where it was tied off to a pier near Blunt Point until weather conditions improved. Due to repeated intense weather and storm debris clean-up, the Army Corp of Engineers was only able to land the carcass on Angel Island on 1/25/2017. Due to continued bad weather and boat availability, a small team was only able to get to the carcass for a partial necropsy on 2/6/2017.

He may have seen one of the whales breathing far away and tried to get closer for a photo and went right over a humpback. SFPD works on the bridge and I made them aware of the situation. We couldn¿t get a vessel number from the boat since it was so far away.
