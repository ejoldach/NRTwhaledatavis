A73 was moved safely to a floating net pen on Washington State's Kitsap Peninsula. She weighed 1,240 pounds and measured 11 feet in length. Veterinarians then did several tests to assess her medical condition and plan her treatment. After a month of rehabilitation in the net pen, A73's ketosis disappeared, her skin improved, and she received medicine to eliminate her worms. She gained 112 pounds, weighing about 1,350 pounds when she was hoisted onto the transport vessel for the ride to her home waters off northern Vancouver Island on July 13, 2002. A73 made a smooth trip up the coast to Johnstone Strait between the Canadian mainland and Vancouver Island. At Dong Chong Bay on Hanson Island she was unloaded into another net pen to recover from the trip. She recovered quickly, and appeared quite excited to be in the area. On July 14, 2002, she responded excitedly to whales from her pod swimming in the area near the net pen.

An attempt was made to tow the carcass to the sea plane base.It failed. A blubber sample was obtained. A larger boat managed to tow the carcass to Polnell Point, NASWI, sea plane base. Necropsy: performed by the additional identifiers above on April 29, 2009. Blubber: dorsal 9.3 cm, lateral 9.1 cm, ventral 9.0 cm. Fluke width 319 cm. Whale measured 41 feet in length. Fair body condition. Moderate decomp. Large amount of blood in body cavity, bruising in some areas of the blubber layer and in some internal organs.Stomach full of recently ingested prey (ghost shrimp). Findings suggestive of blunt force trauma, likely caused by collision with a large ship. Histological testing: Dr. Stephen Raverty. Post mortem decomp and artifactual sloughing of the mucosa from multiple viscera hindered microscopic assessment of the tissues and precluded precise determination of possible antemortem trauma or post mortem putrifaction. In gray whales it is not unusual to observe large quantities of serosanguinous acsites, however, without the presence of blood clots or fibrin deposition along serosal surfaces it is difficult to differentiate frank hemorrhage vs post mortem pooling of fluid within the abdomen. There were no significant lesions within the tissues.The levels of BUN, calcium and phosphorus appear within acceptable limits for a stranded cetacean. PCR of pooled tissues was negative for morbillivirus. No bacteria isolated. The carcass was left at site for cleaning by scavengers. Several weeks later the CPSMMSN collected as many bones as could be found, including the entire skull, mandible and baleen, vertebrae, ribs, scapulae for educational/scientific purposes.

The skin was sunburned and sloughing off in sheets. There were several barnacles along the dorsal surface, on and under pec fins and on rostrom. Estimated 10% coverage. There was bleeding noted from barnacle wounds under the right pec fin. Several bird pecks were noted. Responders reported possible vessel prop strike on dorsal surface from behind skull and continuing back for about 6'. Cuts 1/4"" to 1"" deep. Fresh scars. At necropsy these scars were considered to be superficial. Blood was oozing from the blowhole. The eye was starting to bubble from the sun. There was a slight odor, but no bloating noted yet. The animal appeared to be underweight. There were signs of human interaction-entanglement scars on tailstock indicating an old injury unrelated to the stranding. A full necropsy was performed on 4/13 by Cascadia Research Collective, Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network and Dr.Michael Etnier, UW. COD undetermined at this time.",

The report was of a large gray whale floating just offshore approximately 1 mile south of the South Whidbey State Park beach access. Matt Klope and Howard Garrett of the Stranding Network investigated the carcass on Sunday, April 10. The carcass of the adult female was emaciated. No major injuries were noted. The whale was not one of the 10-12 grays that come into our waters to feed for several months each spring. Matt removed some whiskers for possible analysis as well as part of the ""chin"" on the mandible for researchers to check for a possible ""sensory organ"" suspected to be located in that region. A necropsy was performed on April 12 by Cascadia Research Collective and the CPSMMSN. Several scars on the ovary may mean that the female had had several calves. The stomach was empty except for some organic material and small rocks. The intestines were completely empty. There were lots of small nodules throughout the intestine. Samples were taken for analysis. The CPSMMSN collected several blubber samples for testing for levels of dioxins and furans. The strip of baleen from the left side of the jaw was collected. Cascadia Research Collective will prepare the necropsy report. The carcass was left at site at this fairly remote area of beach in an attempt to collect the second strip of baleen at some future date.",

May possibly be same whale reported to NOAA floating ~100 mile off Cape Flattery by Canadian Coast Guard on 31 May. Drift patterns mapped by Canadian Coast Guard estimtated it would be heading south and east. Email from the Royal Canadian Navy below. I am one of the surveillance officers here at the Canadian Forces MARPAC HQ. I am emailing you in regards to the dead whale that you were inquiring about earlier this morning to the Op Centre Watch Floor. The flight crew that spotted the carcass surmised that it was a fin whale carcass, and it was spotted approx. 100 nm West of the mouth of Juan De Fuca Strait (Cape Flattery). It's location was 47 35 N 127 30W at about 10:00 AM on 31 May. Doing some regressive drift modelling going back 3 weeks, we determined that it had made it's way southbound before it was sighted, with the probability that it would continue on its southerly drift pattern. Drift modelling showed that it did not move very far south to the point where it was sighted given no windage effects. As for current position, we have not been able to ascertain its location since first and last sighting on 31 May. Please feel free to ask any questions if you have.

Based on the necropsy it is very likely that the whale died due to a shipstrike although not quickly. The flesh around injured area from ship strike was necrotic rather than bruised. This may have been because the whale lived through the injury and succombed to secondary bacterial infections from the injury. Stomach was empty. Bones and baleen were collected by Makah tribal members for cultural purposes pursuant to Makah Fisheries Annual Regulation 2014-2. Internal observations were similar to external observation that a large injury occurred to the left side of the dorsal surface of the whale. Tissue around the injury was very necrotic and friable. The rib immediately under where the injury occurred was broken, the ribs adjacent to the broken rib appeared normal. Stomach was mostly empty suggesting that the whale had not recently eaten before it died. Most of the internal organs were too necrotic and decomposed to be of much use for evaluation or histology.

The presumed mother, K27, surfaced after a long dive seen pushing the fetus for a single surfacing run, and then the fetus was not visable. Email correspondence about the observed event is attached to the hard copy Level A. UPDATE:After exchanging notes with vet colleagues the best estimation is that the fetus was probably around a year into gestation.

The USCG flew over and confirmed (pictured above) at 10:35AM. Location was relayed as 2NM off shore and approx. 5NM north of Willipa Bay Entrance. Whale throat was distended floating belly up high in the water.  On Tuesday August 7th received an report that whale was floating ~¿ nm from shore off and ¿ mile south of Grayland Beach Road by shore observers from the Westport Aquarium, WDFW shellfish, NOAA Enforcemnt and Grayland Beach State Park from 1000-1900. Observers sighted the gear (orange bouys) and reports that whale appeared to be anchored in place and not moving location pictures were taken by due to distance gear was only able to be seen by binocular not in photos. While stranding network members were prepared to respond to the whale to collect entangling gear and conduct a necropsy if it came ashore, there were no further sightings until Thursday. This was partially due to fog conditions of shores and likely because whale had moved further out. Observers searched all beaches from Ocean City to Mouth of Columbia River. On Thursday August 9th, at 13:30, a report came from a commercial fishing vessel approximately 2 to 3 nm offshore 46° 52.9' N / 124° 12.7' W to the south west of the entrance to Grays Harbor. With hopes that it may yet come ashore, stranding network teams remained on stand-by. Pictures where taken by RP and sent to WDFW. No bouys were note in picture but photos only of the left side of whale. On Friday August 10th a USCG buoy tender observed the whale near buoy # 2 (46° 52.7¿ N / 124° 12.6¿W) at 11:30. With hopes of retrieving the entangling gear, images and skin and blubber samples a team of Cascadia Research Collective, Sealife Response Rehab and Research and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife responded and located the animal at 16:20 at 46° 55.6¿N / 124° 12¿ W to the north west of the north jetty off Ocean Shores. Unfortunately, all lines and buoys were removed before our arrival. We were able to confirm this as the same animal reported on August 6th using pigmentation on the pleats from both sightings. Two deep impressions with a three-strand line pattern on the right pectoral and line marks and abrasions around tail stock and peduncle indicated that the whale had been entangled recently. The team collected still photographs and underwater images from a gopro mounted on a pole. However, water clarity of less than one foot limited the ability to detect any rope or other wounds around the mouth and other submerged body parts. The team was able to collect skin and blubber sample (~10-12 cm) from the right side abdomen. The whale was left with green spray paint marks (the letter `W¿ on the right side of the pleats and double letter `W¿ on its left). On August 11th ~1900 Whale was sighted just ¿ mile north of the Ocean City no drive away ~100 feet off shore. On August 12th whale had landed ~1 mile North of the Ocean City no drive area. On August 13th CRC staff and Intern conducted a limited necropsy and exam on the whale.. 8/10: Bloated, floating belly up, skin baked and beginning to crack and fall off. Entanglement scars at peduncle and R pec fin (see HI comments). 8/13: on beach, skin slouging in large chunks, shark bites present (post mortem).
